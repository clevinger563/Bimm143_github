Today we will make a step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy. 

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"
read.delim(candy_file)
candy=read.csv(candy_file,row.names=1)
head(candy)
```
>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset? 85 different candy types. 

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```


>Q2: How many fruity candy types are in the dataset? It appears after summing the column with fruity in it, there are 38 total fruity candies. 

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```


```{r}
candy[candy$fruity == 1, ]
```




```{r}
candy["Twix",]$winpercent
```

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value? My favorite candy in the dataset is Twix and its win percent value is 81.6421%. 
>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”? The win percent value for KitKat is 76.7686%. 
>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”? The winpercent value for Tootsie Roll Snack bars is 49.6535%. 

## Exploratory Analysis

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset. 

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?
Yes the winpercent variable needs to be scaled differently than the other variables.

It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` needs to be on a different scale. 

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?
The 0 and 1 represent the cases where this candy type was either chosen as a favorite or not among the group with the mean of all such values displayed. 1 represents a selection of  the chocolate candy and 0 represents not a selection of chocolate as the favorite candy. 

>Q8. PLot a histogram of a winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=30)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fil="lightbulb")
```

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

>Q9. Is the sitribution of winpercent values symmetrical?
The distribution is not symmetrical. There are more data points clustered to the left than to the right.  

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?
No, it is below 50% for the median at 47.83%, but the mean is slightly above 50% at 50.32%.. 

>Q11. On average, is chocolate candy higher of lower ranked than fruit candy? Chocolate candy is much higher on average than fruit candy. 


```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds, ]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

```{r}
fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.candy <- candy[fruity.inds, ]
fruity.win <- fruity.candy$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```

```{r}
candy [as.logical(candy$fruity),]$winpercent
```


>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant? The t-test shows a statisically signficant difference between these two values confirmed by a very low p value less than 0.05 at 2.87137e-08.

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruity.win)
ans
```

Yes, with a p-value of 

```{r}
ans$p.value
```

## 3. Overall Candy Rankings

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` function and `order()` function

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x, decreasing=TRUE)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```

>Q14 What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set? The top five are seen below in the first five rows after applying the order function being Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters. 

```{r}
inds <- order( candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```
```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing=TRUE)
candy[inds,]
```
Make a bar pplot and order it by winpercent values
> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```
>Q16: This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent? Seen below.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent, 
      y=reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent, fill="chocolate")) +
 geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want  - with chocolate and `fruity` candy together with whether it is a bar or not. 

```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"

mycols
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=mycols)
```
```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[ as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"


mycols
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=6)
```

>Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy? The worst ranked chocolate candy per this graph and more clearly seen on the lab handout is the sixlets candy. 
Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy? The best ranked fruity candy is the Starburst. 
## 4 Winpercent vs. Pricepercent plot 

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
mycols[ as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 20)

```
```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```


>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck? Reese's Miniatures. 
>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?  The top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset are Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring Pop, Hershey's Krackel, and Hershey's Milk Chocolate. Among these 5, the least popular is Nik L Nip. 
## 5: Explore the Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```

>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?
chocolate and fruity are the most anti-correlated towards the upper left quadrant of the screen. 


>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated? The most positively correlated variables are the chocolate and winpercent variables. 


## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to scale out input 'candy' data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all the others in the dataset. 

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
pca$x
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps=6, col=mycols) +
  theme_bw()
```
These tend to be hard on the right side of plot on fruity side. 
The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot. 

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation)+
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```

>Q24: What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?
Of the three that we can see, the variables that most contribute to PC1 in the positive direction are fruity with the highest contribution, followed by pluriplus with the second highest contribution, and lastly followed by hard candies with the lowest contribution. These contributions make sense considering the large variation in variables like winpercent among the variety of fruity candies and further with the pluriplus candies, given that this pluriplus is an amalgamation of many different candies, there is bound to be much variation across the different candies that comprise it and thus is bound to potentially stray from the cluster of other candy data points and thus contribute heavily to PC1, which attempts to connects many of the data points in a line and capture the most variation. Further, as elaborated for fruity candy, in the barplot above, we saw much variation across fruity candies with some having very high winpercent values and some having not very high winpercent values and with such variation, it is likely to be more variable compared to other candy types which have less internal variation and may stray from the other data points and thus influence most the variation captured by PC1, which captures the most, and thus have the highest contribution. The same logic can be applied to bars; however, less variation across this candy type will lead to a lower contribution and more commonality with the other data points.
